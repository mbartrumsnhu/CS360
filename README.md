Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
In this class I got the honor to develop an app that handles inventory for any user. We first chose what we wanted to develop, proeject 2 we developed and UI, and finally we put it all together and made it a working app.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I needed to make sure that users were able to create accounts, create iventory where they can edit how much they have and substract or add throughout tim, and finally the key thing was that I needed to have a way for SMS message that inventory has reach zero. While designing the UI I wanted to make it simple to naviagate. By doing this I thought about the placement of inveontry when a client hits and add button. I believe they were succeful because after testing I can see that I manage that just fine.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
When it came to the UI I played around with coding and using the system that I can place my items correctly. Without that i would have ahd trouble making a decent looking UI. I will use this in the future because this will give me more ways to have a further look of my app.
